**Introduction**

-   Briefly talk about the importance and beauty of understanding math, not just knowing it.
-   Discuss the prevalent issue in math education where concepts are often presented as facts to memorise rather than tools to understand and use.
-   Share your intention to dive deep into sine and cosine functions, and the quadratic formula.

**Part 1: The Sine and Cosine Functions**

-   Introduction to Trigonometry
    -   Brief overview of what trigonometry is and its real-life applications.
    -   Highlight how these functions are usually taught in traditional education and the issues with such an approach.
-   Derivation of Sine and Cosine
    -   Walk through the derivation using the unit circle.
    -   Explain how we could have arrived at these functions ourselves.
-   Real-Life Applications of Sine and Cosine
    -   Illustrate with some real-life examples.
-   Analogy for Understanding Sine and Cosine
    -   Come up with a non-math analogy that encapsulates the key aspects of these functions.
-   Discuss how understanding sine and cosine as tools rather than just facts can deepen understanding and interest.

**Part 2: The Quadratic Formula**

-   Introduction to Quadratic Equations
    -   Brief overview of what quadratic equations are and their real-life applications.
    -   Highlight how the quadratic formula is usually taught in conventional education and the issues with this approach.
        -   What is a discriminant and what does it do in this function?
-   Derivation of the Quadratic Formula
    -   Explain how we complete the square to derive the formula.
    -   Walk through the steps we would take to invent this formula from scratch.
-   Real-Life Applications of the Quadratic Formula
    -   Illustrate with some real-life examples.
-   Analogy for Understanding the Quadratic Formula
    -   Create a non-math analogy that conveys the intuition behind the formula.
-   Discuss how understanding the quadratic formula as a tool rather than a fact can enhance understanding and utility.

**Conclusion**

-   Reflect on the contrast between traditional math teaching and the approach of understanding the "why" behind mathematical concepts.
-   emphasise the benefits of seeing math as a toolkit for problem solving rather than a set of rigid rules.
-   Encourage readers to embrace the process of rediscovering math and to see its beauty in everyday life.
