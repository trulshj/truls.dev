## Hallaien! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my tiny corner of the digital universe! My name is Truls Henrik,
a 23-year-old software engineer hailing from the frost-kissed landscapes of Norway with an appetite for mathematics.

I've often found myself grappling with mathematical concepts,
staring down the barrel of what appeared to be an impenetrable fortress of numbers and symbols.
It's a tale as old as time: you learn math in school,
think you've left it behind, and then BAM - it rears its head when you least expect it.

But that's where the journey gets interesting.
A few months ago, I took a hard look at my mathematical abilities and realized there were some huge holes where there should have been knowledge.
So, I did what any rational person would do: I set out on an epic quest to teach myself math.

From filling in the holes in my basic understanding of the fundamentals to diving headfirst into the deep end of complex equations,
my self-study voyage has been both challenging and rewarding.

This blog is a chronicle of that journey and a celebration of the joy of learning.

My aim is not to intimidate you with esoteric mathematical concepts and dazzle you with how smart I am,
but to instill a sense of wonder, curiosity, and even joy in exploring math.
I am a firm believer that math can be understood and appreciated by anyone,
provided we shift our perspective and approach it with a touch of creativity and some humour.
If you're wondering how that looks, stick around and you'll find out!

Whether you're aprofessional seeking to polish your skills,
a hobbyist intrigued by the prospect of learning something new,
or a casual visitor, this space welcomes you.

So come along on this mathematical journey as we tackle complex ideas together,
uncovering the mysteries of math and, in the process, changing the way we perceive it.

Happy learning and welcome aboard!
